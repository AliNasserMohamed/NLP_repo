       "       'i said zero flexibility and little time for dating going around sifting through dates to find one that clicks isnt going to be as viable  that has nothing to do with maintaining a relationship ihow youve come to the conclusion i have nothing to offer  merely because i am busy is beyond me       no not really again more made up stuffokay this isnt cool  youre specifically looking to get into a relationship because youre about to enter a life phase where you will not have any resources to give to a relationship   that isi do take it slow thats why im still single but im not interested in making friends i  have friends enough for my liking im interested in going on dates with the intent of entering aabsolutely not for me i find the idea repugnant actuallypeople could have been polite maybe average is a more conservative bet and im not claiming im a social butterfly im just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  i dontim probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out after that i really dont know where to look bars are a definite no i dont understand where people meet theirive tried both ways actually the last few women i have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments i dont know what to do anymore seems i get screwed eitherim actually pretty healthy     sorry you feel that way not sure which ones you met but assholes exist everywhere the number isnt anywhere near  thoughif anything i err on the side of being indifferent definitely not overeageryeah my close friends dont live near me anymore  the issue is that i have been meeting people a good amount and nothing works i want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a  year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like  years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an infj just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an infj ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in  or fewer datesmy infj friend has been with an intj and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an infj over a  month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an infj female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon     if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game you will loseexpectations ofi dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number  is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thei dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert for being wary about someone she doesnt really know number  is cruel but it is how modern dating works    pretty sure this isnt thethanks option  seems most likely it seems whenever i finally get her to open up there is like a cascade of good conversation that finally ensues but it is like pulling teeth initially then iim socially retarded and would know that if a random stranger asked for my contact info then asked me out for drinks or lunch then the person probably isnt interested in just being friendsso i shouldnt be deterred by the fact she doesnt really ever reach out to me i dont enjoy appearing like someone who cant take a hint or who puts someone else in an awkward situation i worryno this seems to fit her pretty wellthanks for the advice everyone i appreciate your taking the time to respond',\n",
       "       'this has to be written with bias or something im not sure how you could even say that truthfully for some reason you put subjectivity for both god and man it says nothing    that makes no how  the main priority of the church is written throughout its texts for the past nearly  years and reverberated throughout the churchs dialogues both before and after the incident aboutthats an annoying phrasing as its just obtuse and confusing to newcomers i dont blame you for your response there    why must the revealed knowledge not speak truth but contain a biasthere are no priestly desk jobs the closest thing you have to being a priest that gets you away from people is being a monk and that in itself is very different  i am telling you they did it outno you really wont you cant just go to an intp and assume their intelligence level that would end in failure dont be afraid to ask big questions when musing with the intp and just try toheresy is like the core reason most all christian infighting occurs everything else is minor disputes about theological opinionsthats exceedingly subjective see what theyre interested in strike up a conversation about it definitely ask them their thoughtsto dismiss my concept of it is to dismiss all history on the topic dismiss what the apostles taught and literally all sects of christianity but fine whateverdo cool shit discuss ideas have patience dont try to judge personally too quickly or control them also make the first move to show youre interested in talking with themi used to feel about the same until i read the book selfmade man where a lesbian butch woman dressed like a man and tried to live as one she noticed herself being considered a feminine man quiteim not sure what the hell is going on in this thread but i would like to say i know no entjs personally i dont think itd be neat thoughall churches are forms of political institutions catholic and orthodox ones have the benefit of being centralized all sects have declared doctrine in one way or another  youre speaking againstand here is the most boring post in the whole threadwhat part if its the idea of a teaching authority you have a problem with all church until the th century if its the idea of a group being guided by the holy spirit in their decisions onfor catholics the church has a dual meaning the whole of the believers the body of christ and the political institution for catholicism their teachings of christ are said to be protected bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle thing themselves again poor decision but that was their decision  the churchs first prioritywell sure then yes the church did protect child offenders the churchs reasoning was the image of the church itself and the their leaderships own ignorance of the size of the problem the churchedit based double postno it really isnt the bible itself is the canon collection of texts the bible was established once the theological and historical work was done to establish the canon and it was not modifiedyes nevermind it because the two claims do not contradict each other at all i could work through how there is no contradiction if youre struggling    i wouldnt say all no thats a theres no way to tell but many of them depend on logic andor history that contradicts or ruins their claims granted there are a few cases of were yet to be able to know but many of it canthe problem of induction is a grand way of humbling yourself about scientific findings when youre younger it brings into question if

everything the universe exists we are to learn to love in itdisappointed  year old reporting in  good luck opthis is exceedingly naive the early church before scripture applied their teaching to better society after scripture it was held in high esteem as a basis to properly better society most workfrom the catholic catechism list of official teaching here is how we are to read the bible  iii

suffer from this illness they have multiple signs in their behavior but have not beeni agree estxbut more likely a j js have that confrontational nature about them ps just want to go with the flow and

age still not convinced she is entj late s no kids marriedhi there   i have a sister who says she is an entj only i am not convinced due to the fact that she notices behavior what other people are discussing when things are out of place etc shetelling you she is emotional could mean she feels alot within it does not nec mean that she is about showing emotion face to face with someone she could also feel more comfortable texting youi am an older infp things dont really change much in how we thinkfeel but they do change in how we communicate and socialize with others as we age my guess is she started wondering about all thei find the sj types have that preppy look going on infps have a laid back look with style that isnt forced look in places where you would not normally go maybe a bookstore at the selfhelp or fantasy section or the corner where they are alone from the rest reading hiking and parks are good places toowell said we are the type that can be most understanding accepting and intrigued by their naturesad it cannot be reciprocated for some i am sure there are ultrahealthy intps out therejust ended a friendship relationship aquaintanceship with an intp i am

morning i want a welsh pembroke corgi they are so cute and have these stumpy legs it looks like they have a wiggle to their walk i have asked alot of people i work with or friends to take the keirsey test what i have noticed is the sjs will be hesitant and question why i want to know their type the rest of the typesi would say that if i truly meant it otherwise there is no point in bringing it uptheatres that show indie films but then you couldnt really meet because we would be watching the movie i like the super secret card idea i dated a couple of esfps they can be very warm and caring in a physical way they are spontaneous which i love because it draws me out of my shell and i become this free spirit they know how toi have been trying to understand the cognitive functionsthis is excellent bravo i go through each of the functions in my mind and ask myself which reflects the person more x or ythis is very inaccurate but i have been right on some its usually the nfs and nts that

inhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvxtfuxfmthere is no relationship established yet practice directness in a kind way this is difficult for infps but it will save you time and energy that can be used for other things thank you for askingi was playing in the streets when i was a young girl and i never thought about whether i had to be girly or not now that i am a grown woman i am not into the makeup clothes etcbut i do feel girli think infps have style without really tryingjust sayin i was married to an estj who would leave me alone in large groups i got used to it and the times i did become more extraverted were the times where the conversations werent superficial i open uphi fellow infps i want to know what your preferred style of dress isthis goes for all the guys as well what do you love to wear when you dont have to dress work appropriate for myself i am ai agree a person with a strong inner core that can be alone for a while after a breakup comes out ahead in the end my guess is he does not want to think and feel about what happened sorry youi am an infp parent and i can say it has brought me closer to my sons as they get older since learning about mbtikeirsey i have introduced
